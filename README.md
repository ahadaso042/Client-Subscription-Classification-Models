# Client-Subscription-Classification-Models

The problem is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese
banking institution. The classification goal is to predict whether the client subscribes a term deposit or not.
The target class is the last attribute (subscribed) and has two values (yes and no).
The training set is in trainset.csv and the test set is in testset.csv. The dataset contains subscribed (yes) and
unsubscribed (no) customers.
